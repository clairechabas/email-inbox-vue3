This is an attempt to build my own mail inbox client to handle my Gmail emails. I'm thinking beautiful, simple, not boring. No idea what that looks like yet.

If you find current mail clients boring too, don't hesitate to reach out ðŸ¤™

### Project setup
This project is using yarn.

Install
```
yarn
```

Launch dev server
```
yarn dev
```

Run tests (coming)
```
yarn test
```

Build app for production (not ready)
```
yarn build
```
### Stack
Just starting out, so stack is very minimalist so far.
Front: Javascript (migration to Typescript in progress), Vue 3, Vite, Scss.
Back: No clue yet, but I'd like to give a try to Supabase if it turns out to be a good fit.
Tools: axios, date-fns.
